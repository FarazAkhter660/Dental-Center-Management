Technologies

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Calendar: react-big-calendar, Moment.js
State Management: React Context
Storage: LocalStorage
Deployment: Vercel

Troubleshooting

Styling Issues: Ensure index.css is imported in index.js and Tailwind is configured in tailwind.config.js.
Calendar Navigation: Verify dependencies (react-big-calendar, moment) are installed and the toolbar is enabled in CalendarView.jsx.
Deployment Issues: If the live site (https://dental-center-management-woad.vercel.app) shows errors, check the Vercel logs for build failures or missing environment variables. Ensure localStorage data persists by testing with sample logins.
OneDrive Sync: Move the project out of OneDrive if files donâ€™t load during development:mv "C:\Users\faraz akhter\OneDrive\Desktop\dental\dental-dashboard" "C:\Users\faraz akhter\Desktop\dental-projects\dental-dashboard"
cd "C:\Users\faraz akhter\Desktop\dental-projects\dental-dashboard"
